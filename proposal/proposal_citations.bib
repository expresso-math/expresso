	title = {A Handwriting-Based Equation Editor},
	abstract = {Current equation editing systems rely on either textbased equation description languages or on interactive construction by means of structure templates and menus. These systems are often tedious to use, even for experts, because the user is forced to "parse" the expressions mentally before they are entered. This step is not normally part of the process of writing equations on paper or on a whiteboard. We describe a prototype equation editor that is based on handwriting recognition and automatic equation parsing. It is coupled with a user interface that incorporates a set of simple procedures for correcting errors made by the automatic interpretation. Although some correction by the user is typically necessary before the formula is recognized, we have found that the system is simpler and more natural to use than systems based on specialized languages or template-based interaction.},

	abstract = {In this work we address the problem of how pen-based interfaces for mathematical software systems can be organized. We describe our approach to such interfaces for mathematical packages and document processing software. Our architecture includes components for ink collection, mathematically-oriented recognizers, portability support and interfaces to applications. We summarize aspects of mathematical handwriting recognition and discuss the methods we have used for individual character recognition and overall expression analysis. We present our pen-based computing environment Mathink and give an overview of facilities for training, ink annotation, and testing. 1},

	title = {Mathematical Expression Recognition: A Survey},
	shorttitle = {Mathematical Expression Recognition},
	abstract = {. Automatic recognition of mathematical expressions is one of the key vehicles in the drive towards transcribing documents in scientific and engineering disciplines into electronic form. This problem typically consists of two major stages, namely, symbol recognition and structural analysis. In this survey paper, we will review most of the existing work with respect to each of the two major stages of the recognition process. In particular, we try to put emphasis on the similarities and differences between systems. Moreover, some important issues in mathematical expression recognition will be addressed in depth. All these together serve to provide a clear overall picture of how this research area has been developed to date.  Key words: error detection and correction -- mathematical expression recognition -- performance evaluation -- structural analysis -- symbol recognition  1},

@mastersthesis{matsakis_recognition_1999,
	title = {Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions},
	abstract = {In recent years, the recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions has re- cieved an increasing amount of attention in pattern recognition research. The di- versity of approaches to the problem and the lack of a commercially viable system, however, indicate that there is still much research to be done in this area. In this thesis, I will describe an on-line approach for converting a handwritten mathemat- ical expression into an equivalent expression in a typesetting command language such as {TEX} or {MathML}, as well as a feedback-oriented user interface which can make errors more tolerable to the end user since they can be quickly corrected.
The three primary components of this system are a method for classifying iso- lated handwritten symbols, an algorithm for partitioning an expression into sym- bols, and an algorithm for converting a two-dimensional arrangements of symbols into a typeset expression. For symbol classification, a Gaussian classifier is used to rank order the interpretations of a set of strokes as a single symbol. To partition an expression, the values generated by the symbol classifier are used to perform a constrained search of possible partitions for the one with the minimum summed cost. Finally, the expression is parsed using a simple geometric grammar.},

	abstract = {{CellWriter} is an open source handwriting input panel for the X Window System. Rather than specializing in recognizing a single language or group of languages, Cell- Writer relies on entry via a grid interface and robust character recognition to provide naturally multilingual handwriting recognition capacity. Elastic matching augmented with a greedy mapping algorithm to account for variability provide the underlying recognition mechanism.
